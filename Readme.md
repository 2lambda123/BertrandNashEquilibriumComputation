# BertrandNashEquilibriumComputation

This is a python library consisting of an implementation of different algorithms to compute a Bertrand-Nash equilibrium of the price competition game for differentiated products, 
when the demand is a multinomial logit, or a mixture of these. It also includes algorithms to compute equilibrium of an entry game with minimum profit requirements.
This would be of interest to econometricians who wish to do counter factual evaluation given mixed-logit demand models. 
In order to use this library market.py must be imported in the code. Then an instance of market has to be created and initiated.
